# 🧪 Linux Server Enumeration & Process Management Lab

## Overview
This lab focused on practicing foundational Linux administration and enumeration techniques commonly used in cybersecurity. The tasks simulate real-world processes such as managing services, monitoring systems, handling automation via cron, and inspecting system logs for activity.

---

## 🔧 Key Concepts Practiced
- Navigated directories using `cd`, `pwd`, and listed contents with `ls`
- Identified running processes using `ps`, `top`, and `htop`
- Found open ports and listening services with `netstat`, `ss`, and `lsof`
- Managed background jobs using `&`, `jobs`, `fg`, and `bg`
- Used `cron` to view and understand scheduled jobs
- Parsed environment variables using the `env` command
- Launched a Python HTTP server to host content using `python3 -m http.server`
- Installed and updated software using `apt-get` and managed repositories with `sources.list`
- Reviewed log files from `/var/log` such as `auth.log`, `syslog`, and `cron.log`

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Ubuntu Linux terminal
- Python 3 (for simple HTTP server)
- Core utilities: `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `netstat`, `lsof`, `nano`, `cron`, `cat`, `grep`

## 🔐 Real-World Applications
- Process and port enumeration are foundational in threat detection and incident response
- Log file analysis helps track unauthorized access or malware behavior
- Cron job auditing can uncover persistence mechanisms used in attacks
- Running basic HTTP servers is useful for controlled file transfers in red team ops or testing
